I'm still trying to determine whether or not I'll be making daily entries into this blog; part of me sees it as a sort-of more private alternative to logging my 100 Days of Code. Unfortunately, today hasn't seen as much actual coding, for some very specific reasons!

It seems that an interviewing opportunity comes up once every three weeks or so, and with that come the usual panicked preparations and efforts to nail down things like "my story" and other behavioral questions. That time has come round again, and starting tomorrow I'll be entering another interview circuit. I'm happy to say that I'm putting more effort into those behavioral questions this time; in past interviews I had slipped up on practicing those in favor of trying to learn algorithms and data structures, and I feel that slip-up showed in my performance.

I'm incredibly excited for the opportunity-- it seems like a great chance to be a part of a huge organization dedicated to the growth and development of its employees, as well as the growth and development of its customer-base.

## Warlock
In Warlock news, I'm still somewhat stuck in the planning phase. I've decided that I want to really put some thought into both the UI flow and the architecting of the database, and that this will require thinking about problems I haven't really thought about before. It's going to be important to not let myself get too caught up in the weeds of optimization and "perfection"; the goal is to do it well enough with room for improvement later.

## In the News
Outside of that, there's talk of another recession coming somewhere down the pipe (hope to get gainfully employed before then) and further talk of trouble in Eastern Europe. Exciting times.
