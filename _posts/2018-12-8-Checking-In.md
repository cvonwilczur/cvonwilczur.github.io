Well; the technical project is complete! I interview Monday for LinkedIn, and from there we'll find out what's in store. The interview will include two hours of technical interview, 1 hour of lunch interview and 1 hour of interviewing with an engineering manager. All-in-all, it should be a marathon. The last time I experienced something similar was when I interviewed for an account management position at OpenDoor.

### The Project

Overall, I feel relatively proud of my project, [Hangmage](https://hangmage.herokuapp.com/). It's an implementation of the classic word-guessing game Hangman, themed to be a sort of '80s-style video game where you, a mage, have to counterspell a portal that has been created before a monster is summoned.

The creation of the app ended up being fairly straightforward-- most of my work involved accounting for instances that would break the app and building in stretch features. I wasn't able to implement a back-end in time, which served as a lesson that I'm still not as familiar with the back-end as I should be.

### The Interviews

I would say I'm not nervous currently. I feel ready for this, despite suffering from a cold. Most of my preparations at this point are around preparing for the behavioral questions and building out "hero stories" for myself. There are several I've thought of that make sense to use in answering multiple questions. I'll need to rehearse a bit.

Separately from that, another consideration is what to expect from the technical interview. It should theoretically be an instance of us walking through my code and iterating over it, improving it as we go along. I'm hopeful that my current knowledge and familiarity with JavaScript will be sufficient.
