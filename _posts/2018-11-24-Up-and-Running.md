Well-- it's finally happened. I'm blogging using Jekyll and Github Pages. Almost a year into this coding journey, and I'm just now settling down to start recounting it. I'm hoping that I'll be able to stick to this format better than the 100 Days of Code challenge on Twitter; I've been finding it hard to stick to using Twitter regularly.

Why now, though?! Well, for starters, the holiday weekend has afforded me 4 days to mess around with installing Ruby, managing multiple Ruby environs, accidentally installing my Jekyll/Github Pages gems into the system's Ruby directory with some ill-used sudo commands and generally realizing that the system integrity protection feature of the Mac OS will be the death of me. The holidays have also given me a chance to reflect a bit on my coding journey so far, and as I've begun journaling more, I'm finding this specific part of my life deserves its own corner of verbose introspection.

Where to begin, though? I suppose from the start:

## Looking Back at the Past Year

I know-- it's premature, but I think it's time to do a retrospective on my year in code. I really started this journey sometime in November or December of 2017-- I can point to then because I distinctly remember applying for my current position and advertising my "I know some code" skills, which at the time were basically just "I made a table in HTML!". I was lucky to have the opportunity to apply for this role-- being in a Product Operations team has allowed me the time and space to develop my coding skills while also interacting with members of my company's Product and Engineering teams. There's some hope that, given time, I'll be able to work more closely with the Engineering teams, but time will tell whether or not that happens.

It's hard not to look at that period as a sort of "pre-Awakening" moment, because when I look at my Github commit history, the action only begins in mid-March of 2018 with several JavaScript commits. By April, I was sharpening up my Python skills with the intent of automating more of my current role, and at the same time I was also plugging through Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree, which had been awarded to me through a Grow with Google scholarship. Some kind of a mad rush took over me during these months, with June through July seeing me smash through the nanodegree, pumping out my final project in a week (a React-based, Yelp-style app). Around the same timeframe, I participated in my first Chingu Voyage, teaming up with two fellow coders to create a clone of Momentum.

August saw me burn through coursework I had created for myself through a combination of Udemy classes-- this was where my first real exposure to backend work came into play. I'm still familiarizing myself with it (just bought a Wes Bos course on Node, as well as an advanced React course that introduces me to GraphQL), but in this time period I built out a Face Recognition app and another Yelp-style app for D&D groups, both with small back-ends using Node/Express and PostgreSQL/MongoDB. At work, I was mostly successful in building out several Python scripts that reduced in half the amount of time it would take for my team to perform their main roles; the web-crawling and PDF-parsing I wrote was able to convert 700-man hours of work into around 350 total man hours.

September's where I sort of hit a low point, with that low point passing into October. I applied for jobs and interviewed for a few roles here in the Valley with some limited success-- the typical answer was something along the lines of "we moved forward with a candidate who had more experience." I made some weak, half-hearted attempts to code together a personal portfolio website, but it seemed like the "energy" was gone. I've heard this described by bootcamp graduates-- once they graduate, the pressure and zeal drops off and the depressing reality of applying for jobs hits. Each interview would steal away my focus, forcing me to speed-read my way through Angular docs or prep for algorithms and data structures that were mostly unfamiliar to me.

In the time since then, I've hit a better pace, and I think I'm ready to move forward with a much clearer focus.

## The Road Ahead

There are several things I'm looking forward to working on as I look toward the near future!

### Warlock

My passion project-- the one I've been dreaming about and chewing on during most commutes to work and home. I have the loose outlines of an idea for a Dungeons & Dragons app meant to simplify much of the work performed by a Dungeon Master who wants to run a hexcrawl/sandbox-style game. Basically, Warlock is a hexcrawl generator/manager that reduces the overhead a Dungeon Master has to deal with when running a hexcrawl-style adventure, allowing the DM to more easily explore this type of game without having to put in a significant amount of effort in generating a world that feels fleshed out.

I have rough ideas for what the core features will be, but I haven't finished spelling them out. CodeMentor.io's ["How to Become a Programmer: 8 Steps to Building an App from Scratch"](https://www.codementor.io/codementorteam/how-to-build-app-from-scratch-beginner-programmer-7z0atq56w) has been useful in guiding the overall creative vision into clear steps, allowing me to better understand _what it is I want to build_ before I start writing any code. I'm hopeful to have a rough version ready for beta-testing by March, but in the meantime I'm still in the planning phases.

### Work

At work, I fully intend on integrating my Python scripts into our company's web application, with the features being accessible from an internal page. This would allow my fellow teammates the ability to use the scripts without having to install Python and the app's dependencies on their local machines, which has been a constant exercise of patience and Stack Overflow searching on my end. As of now, I've been able to download my company's app and get it running on my local machine, but several questions remain-- for instance, "Do I need to _rebuild the entire app_ just to see a change reflected?" or "Do I really need six terminal windows running different tasks to make a UI change?". These questions are hard to answer on my own; most of the resources I'm using are old wikis and training videos from January of 2016, when our app was still in its "2.0" stage. Moments like these reinforce the humbling reminder that there is still much for me to learn when it comes to the daily life and know-how of a programmer, especially when working on a legacy app, and also that learning in solitude can sometimes be an extremely inefficient endeavor. I hope to work with some friendly engineers soon to get off on the right foot.

### Apprenticeships

I'm going to keep applying to apprenticeship programs! Although the age-old wisdom appears to be that I should apply for jobs sooner than I feel ready for them, I've found that the application process sometimes ends up feeling like a distraction, at least when applying for roles here in AZ. I know I've still got a ways to go before I can really pursue some bigger roles, and I know the only thing standing in the way of that is my own dedication to the projects I have at hand. In the meantime, though, I really do see apprenticeships as a great, next step forward. Programs like Microsoft Leap and LinkedIn Reach allow for an incredible level-up in skills and effectiveness, and I would be remiss to ignore that value in my own journey. I've had some near-misses so far with both, but I have a good feeling about my candidacy in the near future and look forward to exploring these opportunities further.
