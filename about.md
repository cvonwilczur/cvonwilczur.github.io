Hey, I'm Chris!

I'm a journalist/marketer/technical writer/English tutor/insurance broker/account manager/product analyst/self-taught developer/dungeon master-- I've worn a lot of hats over the years.

### Coding

I'm a budding web developer building fun and useful apps for professional and personal use. I work primarily in JavaScript and Python, and over the past year I've built apps like:

[YelpDND](https://yelpdnd.herokuapp.com/groups)
A Yelp-style app for searching for local D&D games and leaving comments and reviews.

[Magic Brain](https://facial-recognition-game.herokuapp.com/)
A simple app for feeding images containing faces to a facial-recognition API powered by ClarifAI.

### Dungeons & Dragons

I'm a huge D&D fan and frequent Dungeon Master-- look out for future live streamed games on Twitch!
